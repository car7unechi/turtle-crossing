# 🐢 Turtle Crossing Game

A simple arcade-style game built with Python's `turtle` module, where the goal is to help your turtle safely cross a busy road filled with moving cars. Each successful crossing increases the difficulty!

## 🎮 How to Play

- Use the **Up Arrow key** to move your turtle forward.
- Dodge the cars coming from **right to left**.
- Reach the top of the screen to level up and increase the speed of the cars.
- If a car hits your turtle... it's game over!
